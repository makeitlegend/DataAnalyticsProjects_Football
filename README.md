A continuously evolving repository dedicated to exploring, analyzing, and modeling football-related datasets using Data Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

This repo is my daily Data/AI practice ground, focused on uncovering structure, patterns, and predictive signals within the football ecosystem — including player performance, injuries, positional attributes, transfer dynamics, team behavior, and emerging trends.

The purpose of this repository is to build a deep, practical, and research-oriented portfolio that showcases ongoing exploration of real-world football data, experimentation with modeling techniques, and long-term analytical projects aimed at understanding how elite performance is measured, predicted, and developed.
